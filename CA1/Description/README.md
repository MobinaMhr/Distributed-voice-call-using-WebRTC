# Answer to the description questions

## WebRTC
This is a technology that allows direct, peer-to-peer communication between browsers or applications without needing plugins or additional software. Here’s a snapshot of its core elements.

- It enables audio, video, and data sharing directly between devices in real time.
- It establishes direct connections, reducing latency and bandwidth use.
- It works seamlessly across different browsers and operating systems.
- It sends the media via UDP.
- It has a signaling server, a stun server, and a turn server. 

- Real-Time Communication: Allows for immediate audio, video, and data sharing directly between browsers and applications, facilitating seamless real-time interactions.
- Plugin-Free: Operates natively within most modern browsers, eliminating the need for additional plugins or software.
- Cross-Platform Compatibility: Works across different operating systems and browsers, ensuring broad accessibility.
- Secure: Implements encryption protocols like DTLS and SRTP, enhancing the security of media and data transmissions.
- Open Source: Being open-source, it has strong community support and continuous improvements.
- Cost-Effective: Reduces the need for expensive media servers since most data is transferred directly between peers.

But,

- NAT Traversal Issues: Connecting through firewalls and NATs can be challenging, often requiring additional STUN and TURN servers.
- Inconsistent Performance: The quality and reliability of connections can vary greatly depending on network conditions and configurations.
- Complexity in Setup: Implementing WebRTC can be complex due to the need for signaling servers, STUN/TURN servers, and handling various browser-specific issues.
- Latency: Relay via TURN servers adds latency compared to direct connections, which can affect real-time applications.
- Security Concerns: While encryption is a benefit, managing and ensuring security compliance can be complex.

## Signaling Server
The signaling server plays a crucial role in WebRTC by facilitating the exchange of Session Description Protocol (SDP) information between peers. Here's how it works:

Exchange of SDP: Before two peers can establish a direct connection, they need to share their SDP data, which contains crucial information about media capabilities and network configurations.

Role of Signaling Server: The signaling server acts as a mediator, allowing peers to send their SDP offers and answers to each other. It’s not involved in the media path but is essential for initiating the connection.

The remote description is sent via signaling server.

## Coturn
Coturn is an open-source library that, when properly configured, provides both STUN and TURN server functionalities.

- Coturn enables WebRTC to function effectively even in environments where direct peer-to-peer connections are restricted. This adaptability makes WebRTC usable in a variety of network configurations, from highly secure corporate firewalls to typical home internet setups.

- Coturn implements robust security protocols such as DTLS and TLS, ensuring that data remains encrypted and secure, even when routed through the TURN server.

But,

- Relaying all data through the Coturn server results in substantial bandwidth consumption, particularly for high-quality video and audio streams. Consequently, this can drive up costs for applications with high usage rates.

- Routing data through Coturn introduces additional latency compared to direct peer-to-peer connections, which might slightly hinder real-time interactions. This trade-off is crucial when direct connectivity between peers is not possible.

## TURN
When direct peer-to-peer connections can't be established, WebRTC relies on TURN (Traversal Using Relays around NAT) servers. TURN servers act as intermediaries, relaying data between the two peers.

Relay Mechanism: When a direct connection is not possible, the communication path is split. Peer1 sends data to the TURN server, which then relays it to Peer2, and vice versa.

Server Functionality: This setup ensures the connection remains functional, even in restrictive network environments where NAT traversal and firewall rules block direct peer-to-peer connections.

## STUN
The STUN server assists in the discovery of ICE candidates, helping devices identify their public IP addresses and ports to facilitate direct peer-to-peer communication.

## ICE Candidates
Every device connected to the internet has a unique IP address, managed by routers or switches. Given the limited number of IPv4 addresses compared to the multitude of devices on the network, WebRTC uses ICE (Interactive Connectivity Establishment) candidates to navigate these complexities.
ICE Candidates are additional network data that help in routing traffic between devices. They include information like IP addresses and ports used by a device.


## Collaboration of Components
The audio is transmitted using specific **track** or streams. Each track represents a particular type of media (like an audio track for voice or a video track for video).

The **description** which refers to the `Session Description Protocol` (SDP), contains all the necessary details about how the media streams (tracks) should be set up, including codec information, network information, and more. This protocol ensures that both peers can understand and manage the media tracks properly.

1. When initiating a WebRTC session, the process starts with signaling to exchange essential connection details. 
2. Next, the ICE (Interactive Connectivity Establishment) framework attempts to establish a connection using a STUN server. 
3. If this approach fails, the connection defaults to a TURN server, such as Coturn, which securely relays data between peers. 

This mechanism guarantees WebRTC's reliability across diverse networks.
